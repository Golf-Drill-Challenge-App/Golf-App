## Commands

- `npm i`
  - Install dependencies
- `npm run start`
  - Run app, scan QR code on phone
- `npm run starttunnel`
  - Run app, can scan QR code on phone
  - Probably a better option for opening the app as a webpage in PC browser, due to [tunnelling](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/?redirected#tunneling)
    - Go to http://localhost:19000 (default option) in browser
    - Styling may be a little wonky vs on phone, but might help for some CSS debugging with Inspect Element
- `npm run format`
  - Run Prettier script to reformat code (standardize indents etc)
